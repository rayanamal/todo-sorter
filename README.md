# TODO Sorter

Input: Your TODOs in JSON format.

Output: Your TODOs in JSON format, sorted with decreasing priority.

How: The program asks you to compare the urgency of a task with another. Using binary traversal it's ensured the sorting is done in the fastest manner (i.e. with the minimum amount of questions).

## Usage

You must have Nushell version 0.101.0 installed on your system (on your PATH) to run this program. No other versions of Nushell are guaranteed to be supported.

```
sorter.nu <todo_list.json>
```

## Maintenance Status

This program is considered done. It might be updated to be compatible with future Nushell versions.
