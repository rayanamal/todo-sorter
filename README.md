# TODO Sorter

Input: Your TODOs in JSON format.

Output: Your TODOs in JSON format, sorted with decreasing urgency.

How: The program asks you to compare the urgency of a task with another. Using binary traversal it's ensured the sorting is done in the fastest manner (i.e. with the minimum amount of questions).

Your progress is saved upon each sort, you don't need to worry about exiting the program e.g. when sorting a long todo list.
